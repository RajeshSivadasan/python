# Zerodha Kite API Implementation using python
I have tried some sample programs to capture tick data using Zerodha Kite API. Please validate and use at own risk.
Kite_TickToCandle - Converts the ticks stored (generated by the Kite_getTicks script) in the ticks table to 1 min candles
Kite_getTicks - Gets daily tick data and store in sqlite database
GetInstrumentsDaily - Gets daily NSE instruments data through Zerodha Kite API
